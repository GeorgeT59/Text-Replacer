# Text-Replacer

The "Double Quote Replacer" button takes double quotes that aren't normal (in unicode) and replaces them with double quotes that are actually usable in programming. [So if there's no odd double quotes; then it will APPEAR to do nothing; you need different double quotes for it to work.] You can view the screenshot from the program for more details.

**Keep in mind that I created this for work to streamline a process, so I didn't test every scenario outside of its intented purpose.**
-----------------------
The "Quotes to Line Breaker" button takes the words in each line break and adds double quotes to them.

Example (On the left textbox)

This
will
be
double
quotes.

Will turn into:

"This" "will" "be" "double" "quotes."

**Again I didn't test every scenario as this was to streamline a process at work.**
